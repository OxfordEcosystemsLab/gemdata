# Things TODO

+ Define a Plot, Tree and Branch model
+ Make sure UTF-8 import works

# Questions

+ Should a branch _always_ have a B in the code?
+ Should a tree have a sub\_plot or a plot? - currently using a TraitsTree
+ Do we want to include the 'Lugar'
+ Should evaluator be a foreign key?
+ What is replica?
